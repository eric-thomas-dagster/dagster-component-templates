# Conversation Memory Component Example
#
# This component receives messages from upstream assets via IO managers.
# Messages should be passed from upstream assets (like LLM responses) using
# Dagster's IO manager pattern, not hardcoded in the YAML configuration.
#
# To use this component in a pipeline:
# 1. Create an upstream asset that produces message data
# 2. Configure this component to receive that data via IO managers
# 3. The upstream asset's output will be automatically passed as kwargs
