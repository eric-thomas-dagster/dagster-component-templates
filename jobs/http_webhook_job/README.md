# HttpWebhookJobComponent

POST/GET to an HTTP endpoint as a job — heartbeats, status pings, fire-and-forget triggers.

## Dependencies
- `requests`

## What this is
A **Dagster job** (no asset materialized) — the component installs a `dg.job`
plus an optional schedule. Lineage graph stays clean; the work happens
behind the scenes.
